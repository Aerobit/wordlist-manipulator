*10.1 check possible wordlist sizes*

This is a small script to check what the size would be of a wordlist created with for instance 'crunch'.
It only calculates sizes based on the same min/max length of words.

You are prompted to enter ; 
 - the number of characters that would be used in creating the wordlist

 - the length of the words in wordlist (for instance 8, the minumum length for WPA)

 - the number of passphrases your system can handle per second
(you can leave this item blank) 

The script will then calculate the estimated number of lines/words in the wordlist.

If you entered how many passphrases/sec your system can handle, then it will also show you an estimate on how much time it would take to go through such a wordlist.(not the creation time)

Finally it will show the estimated size of the wordlist in Bytes through to Petabytes.

*10.2 Create a wordlist based on dates _(datelist)_*

This script will create a date wordlist (numeric) based on a given range of dates.

You are first prompted for a start date in format yyyy-mm-dd

Then you are prompted for an end date in format yyyy-mm-dd

You then need to enter an output file name for the wordlist.

Then enter the desired output format of the date as per the guidance given.

Finally you can enter whether you want a spacing character in between days/months/years or not.

The script will list all dates in between the dates as specified and will use the output format as chosen as well as include the spacing character if one was entered.

*10.3 Strip SSIDs from a kismet generated .nettxt file*

This script is intended to strip SSIDs from a Kismet generated .nettxt file. 
This can be used to for instance create wordlists with a great number of real-world SSIDs which can be used together with mdk3 to audit hidden SSIDs.

Same as usual, you are prompted for input .nettxt file, and also for an output file for the SSIDs.

*10.4 Basic leetify options for wordlist*

This is a basic form of 'leetifying' a wordlist by choosing which types of letter alteration you want to use.

You will be prompted for an input file and an output file.

Then you will be prompted to choose from a list of different letter alteration possibilities.

*10.5 Leetify/Permute wordlist (Gitsnik's permute.pl script)*

This script is written by Gitsnik, and I shamelessly included it ;) 

It created all possible permutations of the letters in each word and writes these to a new file. 
The only drawback is that this can *massively* increase the wordlist size.
