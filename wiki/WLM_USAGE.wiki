= Using the options menu =

All the options from 1 through to 9 work in the same way ;

After choosing the main option in options menu, you are presented with a sub-menu.

After choosing the required item from the sub-menu, you are prompted to enter an input file and an output file.

Then depending on the option chosen, some further input may be required after which the wordlist will be processed and the output file will be written.

----

There are verifications in place to check for the existance of the wordlist to be manipulated;

If you enter an incorrect input filename, you will be warned and prompted to enter correct /path/to/wordlist. 


There are also some safeguards put in place in the script to ensure that you dont accidentally overwrite existing files;

If you enter an output filename which already exists, you will be warned that it will be overwritten and prompted to accept or not.
