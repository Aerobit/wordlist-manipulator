#summary General Usage of WLM.

= Installing the script =
*BackTrack*

Download the script to directory of your choice, for instance /root/ ;
{{{
wget -q http://wordlist-manipulator.googlecode.com/svn/wlm -O /root/wlm
}}}

To allow the script to run make it executable: 
{{{
chmod +x /root/wlm
}}}

----

*BackBox Linux*

Either follow the same as above for BackTrack, or grab the deb package that ZEROF from BackBox kindly put together; 
{{{
wget http://wordlist-manipulator.googlecode.com/files/wlm-0.0.7_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i wlm-0.0.7_all.deb
}}}

----


= Running the script =


* * WLM can be used in 2 ways ; *
 # List all possible permutations of a (single) word using Gitsnik's permute.pl script.
 # Alter a wordlist following the options as seen in the options menu.

Running wlm on a single word to list all possible permutations of that word (in this example the word 'one') ;

./wlm one
}}}

----

= Using the options menu =

All the options from *1* through to *9* work in the same way ;

After choosing the main option in options menu, you are presented with a sub-menu.

After choosing the desired option from the sub-menu, you are prompted to enter an input file and an output file.

Then, depending on the option chosen, some further input may be required after which the wordlist will be processed, the output file will be written and a summary of the first and last 3 lines of the newly created file will be shown.

----

There are verifications in place to check for the existance of the wordlist to be manipulated;

If you enter an incorrect input filename, you will be warned and prompted to enter correct /path/to/wordlist. 



There are also some safeguards put in place in the script to ensure that you dont accidentally overwrite existing files;

If you enter an output filename which already exists, you will be warned that it will be overwritten and prompted to either overwrite or cancel the operation.

_This overwriting will not work in BackBox if you do not run the script as root !_ ; 
{{{
sudo wlm
}}}
