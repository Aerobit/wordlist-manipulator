wlm is a wordlist manipulation tool written to provide an easy menu-based possibility to cover the most used manipulation tasks.

wlm was written for use on BackTrack linux, however provided the required permissions are in place it should work on most Linux systems.

wlm is intended to simplify wordlist manipulation tasks by having the most common wordlist manipulation tasks done through an clear menu.
